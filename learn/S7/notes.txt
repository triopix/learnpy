1. Python Ditionaries are the same as Java Hashmaps<>

## Dictionaries and Sets aren't "SEQUENCE TYPES"
## You cannot access them using index values

- Use a "key" to get individual items from dicts. 
- Dicts store key-value pairs
- Set is an unordered collection of "things" 
- No way to retrieve a specific item from a set, which can be confusing!
- Sets can be very useful

I like python, honestly its pretty good. =)
