def fibonacci(n: int) -> tuple:
    r"""Fibonacci sequence in Python
============================

    Generate a Fibonacci sequence of size `n` (*#. of terms*)

    Through subscript notation :math:`F_{n}` we can define:

       :math:`F_{n = 0} = 0` and :math:`F_{n = 1} = 1`

    and the recursive function:

       :math:`F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \to \{n\in \mathbb{N}, n>1\}`

    Where each subsequent term :math:`F_{n}` is produced from the
    **sum** of the previous two terms :math:`F_{n-1}` and :math:`F_{n-2}`
    in the sequence.

    **Refer to**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence
